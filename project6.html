        <h1>Tilly's Story</h1>
        <p>This film for North Yorkshire Police is based on the experience of a girl called Tilly (not her real name) who was just 14 when she was subjected to a serious sexual assault. As part of her recovery she wrote the poem you can hear in the film, Tilly got in touch with the police and asked if she could help others who may be in a similar situation, suffering silently and not feeling able to speak up. We then worked with the police and Tilly to create this film, adding movement to Tilly’s powerful words, with the hopes that it would be shared and someone may see it and feel empowered to contact the police and get help. </p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>The film was made using both after effects and hand drawn, traditional animation techniques to make it feel like drawings accompanying a diary entry with pencil texture and flickering stills. Contrasting with the camera effects used in the doorway scene, symbolising the damage being done by this "monster" with his glitchy movement, film burns and light leaks invading this charcoal and paper world. </p>

        <p>It was an honor to be a part of this project and if Tilly's Story makes just one person feel safe enough to reach out for help then it feels thoroughly worthwhile.</p>
